## Random Links (01)

I read articles, watch videos, and listen to podcasts. I have a habit of saving links to revisit them later. I thought it would be a good idea to share some of them with you. Here are some random links I found interesting:


- [sightful](https://www.sightful.com/) Spacetop is a laptop for work that uses Augmented Reality to substitue a monitor.
- [Amazon Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/) Amazon Q is generative AI assistant.
