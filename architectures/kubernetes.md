# First attempt to install Kubernetes
the idea is to install Kubernetes on premises to better understand it and to chose a solution that could fit the project I'm involved in.

## Design
different options:

- vagrant single node CoreOS + flannel
- ubuntu + conjure-up + juju
- libvirt + coreos
- manual install of:
  - 

## Installation
- Guest OS linux ubuntu 17.04.
- installed libvirt/qemu
- created two VMs:
  - k8-master
  - k8-node-01
