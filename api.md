# Language API Documentation

Here you can find a list of tools to document APIs

* Javascript - http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/
* Doxygen - http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ (oldish)

## Javadoc
Javadoc is a bit oldish and it could be improved a lot to document java apis. 

[x] create a template to improve the quality of the documentation of the java files to end up with something similar to _Read the docs/Sphinx_ (http://rtfd.org) with a search field highlighitings Tips, Warinings, table of contents. Using bootstrap could be a very convenient option.
